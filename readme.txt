Data_citation_demo
 in current version, it contains two approaches to generating citations for a query. One is tuple level reasoning, the other is schema level reasoning based on query execution. 
 
 
 The main function for tuple level reasoning lies in src/reasoning/Tuple_reasoning1.java. The main function for schema level reasoning lies in src/reasoning/Tuple_reasoning2.java. 
 
 
 The main function of UI lies in src/edu/upenn/cis/citation/ui/QBEApp.java. Currently, we are still working on that.
