This is the first system which enables the automatically generation of citations for arbitrary queries against a certain scientific dataset. Our system modified the code from CoreCover algorithm, which is an implementation for query rewriting using views. You can find the code of Corecover algorithm in this link: (https://github.com/chenlica/alu01-corecover)
