Data_citation_demo
 in current version, it contains two approaches to generating citations for a query. One is tuple level reasoning, the other is schema level reasoning based on query execution. The java file of the first approach is src/reasoning/Tuple_reasoning1.java. The second one is src/reasoning/Tuple_reasoning2.java. Both of the two files contain main function and the generated citation view vector will be output to an excel file associated with query result for each tuple
